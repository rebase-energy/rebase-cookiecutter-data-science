# Rebase Cookiecutter Data Science

**Rebase Cookiecutter Data Science**(based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science)) is a tool for quickly setting up a data science template that incorporates best practices. To learn more about philosophy and motivation behind this template, visit the Cookiecutter Data Science [homepage](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

## Installation

Cookiecutter Data Science v2 requires Python 3.8+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (for an isolated installation in your global environment). Installation command options:

```bash
# With pipx from PyPI (recommended)
pipx install rbds

# With pip from PyPI
pip install rbds
```

## Starting a new project

To start a new project, run:

```bash
rbds
```

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):
